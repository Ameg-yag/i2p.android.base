<h3>Warning: I2P Proxy Not Found</h3>
The WWW Outproxy was not found. 
It is offline, there is network congestion,
or your router is not yet well-integrated with peers.
You may want to retry
as this will randomly reselect an outproxy from the pool you have defined
(if you have more than one configured). 
If you continue to have trouble you may want to edit your outproxy list.
