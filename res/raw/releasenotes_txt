This is ALPHA SOFTWARE. It may crash your phone. Do not rely upon it for strong anonymity. Tunnels may be as short as one hop.

This is only tested on the Droid. You need at least 256 MB of RAM. 512 should be much better.

The app may be moved to the SD card if you have Froyo (2.2) or higher.

The app will work best when you are not changing IPs. If you are moving around, changing WIFI nodes, or switching from cellular to WIFI networks, it won't work well.

There is an HTTP proxy at localhost port 4444 and a transparent IRC proxy at localhost port 6668.

The HTTP proxy is untested (other than with the news fetcher). It should work with Firefox 4 Mobile and the ProxyMob Firefox plugin, if you have at least 512 MB of RAM.

The IRC proxy is tested with the "Android IRC Free" app.

Report results and bugs on the zzz.i2p Android forum.
