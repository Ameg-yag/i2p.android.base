<h2>Using clients with pre-configured tunnels</h2>
<p>The app starts an HTTP proxy at localhost port 4444 and IRC client tunnels at localhost ports 6668 - 6672. The IRC clients are "shared clients" on the same tunnels. Once you see the tunnel icon turn green on the main console (several minutes after startup), you should be able to connect.</p>

<p>The IRC proxy is tested with the "Android IRC Free" app. The IRC proxy destinations are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Port 6668: IRC2P - irc.postman.i2p, irc.freshcoffee.i2p, and irc.echelon.i2p</li>
    <li>Port 6669: irc.welterde.i2p</li>
    <li>Port 6670: irc.telecomix.i2p (probably down)</li>
    <li>Port 6671: irc.killyourtv.i2p</li>
    <li>Port 6672: Nameless IRC - irc.stream.i2p</li>
</ol>
