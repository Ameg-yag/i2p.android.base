******* Please read all of the following *******

WARNING - This is BETA SOFTWARE.
* It may crash your phone.
* Do not rely upon it for strong anonymity.
* Tunnels may be as short as one hop.
* There may be serious security holes in the app.

Minimum Android OS is 2.3 (API 9). It uses a lot of RAM. You need at least 256 MB of RAM. 512 should be much better.

The app may use a lot of RAM even after the router has stopped and there is no icon in the notification bar. Go to Settings -> Applications -> Running Services and stop the I2P service if necessary. Or Settings -> Applications -> Manage Applications -> Running -> I2P and force stop.

The app may be moved to the SD card. The app does not store any files on the SD card.

The app runs on either wifi or mobile networks. For now, the app is relatively low bandwidth. It allows a max of 20 participating tunnels.

The app uses both UDP and TCP for router-router connections, with a maximum of 36 connections on each transport. UPnP is enabled.

I2P's NTP is disabled for API 11 (Honeycomb) and above, as those versions include NTP support. If you have cell service, your phone or tablet should have the correct time. If you do not have cell service, ensure your device has accurate time.

The app will work best when you are not changing IPs. If you are moving around, changing wifi networks, or switching between mobile and wifi networks, it won't work well.


Using clients with the router
-----------------------------

The app starts an HTTP proxy at localhost port 4444 and IRC client tunnels at localhost ports 6668 - 6672. The IRC clients are "shared clients" on the same tunnels. Once you see the tunnel icon turn green on the main console (several minutes after startup), you should be able to connect.

The HTTP proxy is tested with the "Orweb" app. It should also work with Firefox 4 Mobile and the ProxyMob Firefox plugin, if you have at least 512 MB of RAM.

The IRC proxy is tested with the "Android IRC Free" app. The IRC proxy destinations are:
  * Port 6668: IRC2P - irc.postman.i2p, irc.freshcoffee.i2p, and irc.echelon.i2p
  * Port 6669: irc.welterde.i2p
  * Port 6670: irc.telecomix.i2p (probably down)
  * Port 6671: irc.killyourtv.i2p
  * Port 6672: Nameless IRC - irc.stream.i2p


Embedded web browser
--------------------

An embedded web browser is provided for convenience that will open .i2p addresses. However, it is not recommended for general use; users should download the Orweb browser, or Firefox Mobile and the ProxyMob Firefox plugin.

The browser does not use the outproxy for regular web sites. Javascript is disabled.

The following problems with eepsites are probably not fixable except on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb - i.e. tablets) and higher due to API limitations. The workaround is to use Firefox Mobile 4 and the ProxMob plugin (see below).
  - Leaks .i2p DNS requests
  - Can't load cross-site images or CSS
  - No POSTs to forms

For eepsites, there are several other things to note:
  - No way to type in addresses
  - Several issues with images and CSS fetches
  - Non-HTML links (pdf, text, images, torrent, etc.) probably don't work
  - Frame support is flaky

For eepsites and websites, problems include:
  - No cookies
  - History and back issues


Further anonymity warnings
--------------------------

* Exploratory and Client Tunnels are 2 hops
* Sharing IRC clients on same tunnels allows for linking
* There are .i2p DNS leaks
* Cell phones aren't exactly secure environments
* This app does not attempt to "sanitize" your phone, make you safe from Google, or capture and route traffic from any other apps over I2P
* The app does not require root or do anything with iptables, for example, to route or block traffic.
