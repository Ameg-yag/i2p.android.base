# Fixes

- Replace AddressbookSettingsActivity, or open it with an implicit Intent from Settings
    <Meeh> If I goto settings->addressbook it crashes
    <str4d> I have an Intent specified in the settings XML
    <str4d> But I can't specify the package there, because the package depends on the flavor
- Better addressbook column widths
    <zzz> on the i2ptunnel and addressbook pages on the tablet, the columns are too skinny, they aren't as wide as the tab
    <zzz> only a few addressbook entries wrap but on i2ptunnel everything is wrapped and most of the screen is empty
- Graph config issues
    <zzz> all the graphs are disabled on the config page, but on the graphs page it shows a rate tab anyway
    <zzz> and no clue that you have to enable the graphs
    <zzz> not sure if they are enabled by default or not - I updated from old install
    <zzz> but even after I enabled some graphs, it still shows this rate tab that does nothing on the tablet, but goes back to the other page on the phone

# Short-term

- Display release notes directly on new router version
- Text content
  - Move help content from release notes to help page
  - Rewrite release notes to be release-specific
  - Fill out help page
- Fix release notes UI, either make back button use clear or add buttons
- NetDB tablet view fixes
  - Refresh detail fragment when changing tab
  - Move list to correct item when changing tab
  - Create nav history when viewing RI from LS
- Include GeoIP db for country info
- Maybe change router-off mechanic for various pages? Enable as they become available?
- Add "copy (error) log" option

# Medium-term

- Expose log level overrides
- Improve graphs
  - Show time on bottom axis
  - Show fixed x range, not only available data
  - Think about pan/zoom
  - How to persist data across restarts?
- I2PTunnel
  - Show all messages somewhere
  - Improve detail page, expose advanced settings
  - Add edit page

# Long-term

- Remote router support
  - Implement a "router wrapper" that can represent a local or remote router
  - Implement/use client APIs to talk to remote router
    - I2CP
    - I2PControl
