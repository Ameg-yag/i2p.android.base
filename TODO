# Fixes

- Better twopane column widths
    <zzz> on the i2ptunnel and addressbook pages on the tablet, the columns are too skinny, they aren't as wide as the tab
    <zzz> only a few addressbook entries wrap but on i2ptunnel everything is wrapped and most of the screen is empty

# Short-term

- Disable uPnP when on cell networks
    <zzz> spewing UPnP out into cell networks is a waste of time at best and a security risk at worst, but you really want it for wifi
- Display release notes directly on new router version
- Fill out help pages
- Rewrite release notes to be release-specific

- NetDB tablet view fixes
  - Refresh detail fragment when changing tab
  - Move list to correct item when changing tab
  - Create nav history when viewing RI from LS
