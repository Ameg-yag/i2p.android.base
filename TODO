# Fixes

- Better addressbook column widths
    <zzz> on the i2ptunnel and addressbook pages on the tablet, the columns are too skinny, they aren't as wide as the tab
    <zzz> only a few addressbook entries wrap but on i2ptunnel everything is wrapped and most of the screen is empty

# Short-term

- Disable uPnP when on cell networks
    <zzz> spewing UPnP out into cell networks is a waste of time at best and a security risk at worst, but you really want it for wifi

- Text content
  - Move help content from release notes to help page
