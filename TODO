# Fixes

- Better twopane column widths
    <zzz> on the i2ptunnel and addressbook pages on the tablet, the columns are too skinny, they aren't as wide as the tab
    <zzz> only a few addressbook entries wrap but on i2ptunnel everything is wrapped and most of the screen is empty
- Create tunnel wizard
    <zzz> in the tunnel create wizard:
    <zzz> 'this could be the full base 64 destination key, or an i2p url from your address book"
    <zzz> 'host name' better than 'URL'. Technically speaking, a host name is not a URL
    <zzz> hmm would be nice if they could be shared-client or have an option
    <zzz> was setting up email tunnels
- I2PTunnel details
    <zzz> on the i2ptunnel details, it lists both a 'target' and 'access point' for clients, with the same info
    <zzz> generally we use 'target' for servers and 'access point' for clients, never both
- Browser
    <zzzccc> Bug report: i2p browser treats 302 as an error
    <zzzccc> Bug 2: rotate screen in i2p browser seems to go back one page

# Short-term

- "Start on Boot" option
- Graceful shutdown option
    <zzzccc> Request: graceful shutdown
- Disable uPnP when on cell networks
    <zzz> spewing UPnP out into cell networks is a waste of time at best and a security risk at worst, but you really want it for wifi
- Setting for TCP and UDP ports
- I2PTunnel
  - Show all messages somewhere
  - Improve detail page, expose advanced settings
  - Add edit page
- Progress feedback for addressbook subscriptions reload
- Display release notes directly on new router version
- Fill out help pages
- Rewrite release notes to be release-specific
- Fix release notes UI, either make back button use clear or add buttons
- NetDB tablet view fixes
  - Refresh detail fragment when changing tab
  - Move list to correct item when changing tab
  - Create nav history when viewing RI from LS
- Include GeoIP db for country info
- Maybe change router-off mechanic for various pages? Enable as they become available?

# Medium-term

- Network profiles
  - User selects profile in settings
  - Change network participation etc. based on profile
  - Also look at connection type: Connectivity.isConnectionFast()
- Expose log level overrides
- Improve graphs
  - Show time on bottom axis
  - Show fixed x range, not only available data
  - Think about pan/zoom
  - How to persist data across restarts?

# Long-term

- Remote router support
  - Implement a "router wrapper" that can represent a local or remote router
  - Implement/use client APIs to talk to remote router
    - I2CP
    - I2PControl
